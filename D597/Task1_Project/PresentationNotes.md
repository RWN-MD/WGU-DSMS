1. Introduction & Context
"Hi, I’m Russell Nordquist, and this presentation walks through my implementation of Task 1 from the D597 Data Management course.

The scenario centers around HealthFit Innovations, which is building a platform called HealthTrack. This platform collects diverse healthcare data — such as wearable device metrics, EHR records, and patient-reported outcomes — with the goal of supporting improved health management.

The current system used by HealthTrack struggles with scalability and integration, making it difficult to store and analyze this growing volume of structured health data. My task was to design and implement a relational database solution to address this challenge."

2. Business Problem and Solution Design
"The business problem here is twofold:
First, HealthTrack needs a structure that can handle high-volume, multi-source health data efficiently. Second, it requires the ability to perform analysis across sources for insights, while maintaining data integrity.

A relational database model offers an appropriate solution because it allows normalization, referential integrity, and indexing — all of which are essential for handling data from multiple systems."

3. ER Diagram and Entity Overview
"I designed a data model around five main entities. I’ll walk through each of them:"

a. Patient
"The Patient table stores demographic data — such as names, birth dates, gender, and contact details. This serves as the foundation, allowing other data to be tied back to individual users."

b. Device
"The Device table captures the metadata for wearable devices. Each device is linked to a specific patient using a foreign key. We store the device type, manufacturer, and registration date to support traceability and future expansion."

c. HealthMetric
"This table logs data points generated by devices — things like heart rate, step counts, or blood sugar readings. It includes a timestamp and foreign key linking back to the device. This time-series data can grow very large, so the schema supports future indexing and partitioning."

d. EHR_Record
"EHR_Record contains clinical information — such as diagnoses and treatments — gathered from healthcare providers. Each entry references a patient and supports analysis by linking health outcomes to measured behavior."

e. PatientReportedOutcome
"Finally, this table stores self-reported health metrics, including narrative comments. It allows the platform to capture qualitative data directly from patients — adding another dimension to the analysis."

4. Environment and Database Creation
"I completed the implementation in the WGU Virtual Lab using standard SQL.

I started by executing the script 01_create_database.sql, which defines all five tables, along with their primary and foreign key relationships. The structure follows third normal form to avoid redundancy and support efficient joins."

5. Data Import Process
"Once the schema was in place, I moved to data loading using 02_import_data.sql.

I used bulk import syntax — with attention to matching column types and formatting — to bring in sample records from the CSV files provided for fitness trackers and medical records. These datasets represent real-world-style inputs, with varying formats and volumes.

The import succeeded for all key tables, and I validated the data with SELECT queries to ensure referential integrity."

6. Query Execution and Purpose
"To demonstrate functionality, I created three SQL queries in 03_queries.sql, each aligned with the business use case."

a. Query 1 – Abnormal Metrics
"This query retrieves patients who have abnormal readings, such as elevated heart rate values. This could support real-time health alerts."

b. Query 2 – Linking Devices to Clinical History
"This query joins device and EHR data to analyze trends — for example, comparing activity data with diagnoses over time. It shows how integrated data supports broader insight."

c. Query 3 – Tracking Reported Outcomes
"This query looks at patient-reported feedback by time. It could help measure subjective outcomes following treatments or behavior changes."

(Display each query and explain the logic behind JOINs, WHERE clauses, and use of indexes if applicable)

7. Optimization Strategy
"Given the nature of time-series data and anticipated scale, I applied optimization techniques using 04_optimize_queries.sql.

For example, I added an index to the timestamp field in the HealthMetric table to speed up temporal queries.

I also reviewed query plans to ensure filter conditions were pushed down effectively. In test cases, the optimized versions showed measurable improvement in runtime — especially for larger subsets of data."

(Show index creation and execution time comparisons if available)

8. Scalability and Security Design
"To ensure scalability, the schema supports:

Indexing on frequently queried fields like timestamps and foreign keys

Partitioning by date for large tables like HealthMetric

Potential replication or sharding in the future if demand increases

For data privacy and security, I would recommend:

Role-based access control to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information

Encryption for stored data and during transmission

Audit logs to monitor data access — all of which align with HIPAA guidelines."

9. Summary and Reflection
"This solution provides a structured, scalable foundation for integrating and analyzing health-related data.

By combining wearable metrics, clinical data, and patient feedback in one relational model, the platform can support better monitoring and insights over time.

This project helped reinforce the importance of good schema design, indexing, and data integrity in supporting real-world data workflows."

10. Closing
"Thank you for watching my presentation. I’ve appreciated the opportunity to apply database design and implementation skills in a practical scenario like this one."
