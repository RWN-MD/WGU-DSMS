# HealthFit Innovations: HealthTrack Database Design and Implementation

This document outlines the design, implementation, and presentation plan for a relational database solution aligned with the HealthFit Innovations scenario. The solution addresses HealthTrack’s need to efficiently store, manage, and analyze diverse health-related data from wearable devices and electronic health records (EHRs).

## Part 1: Design Document

### A. Business Problem and Proposed Data Structure

#### A1. Business Problem

HealthFit Innovations’ HealthTrack platform integrates data from various sources (e.g., wearable devices, EHRs). The current database system struggles with:
- **High data volume** leading to performance bottlenecks.
- **Data silos** preventing unified analytics.
- **Limited scalability** to handle real-time data influx.

Without a robust solution, HealthTrack cannot efficiently provide real-time monitoring and personalized health insights. A scalable relational database is needed to integrate and query data rapidly.

#### A2. Proposed Data Structure

A relational schema is proposed to capture core entities:
1. **Patient**: Stores demographic and clinical data.
2. **Device**: Tracks information about wearable devices.
3. **HealthMetric**: Logs wearable data (heart rate, steps, etc.).
4. **EHR_Record**: Contains medical data from patient visits.
5. **PatientReportedOutcome**: Stores patient-submitted health information.

Each entity will have a primary key (e.g., `patient_id` for Patient). Foreign keys (e.g., `patient_id` in EHR_Record) ensure data integrity and enable efficient joins.

#### A3. Justification for a Database Solution

- **Data Integrity**: Relational constraints maintain consistency across tables.
- **Scalable Queries**: Indexes and normalization optimize performance for high data volumes.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: A well-designed schema supports quick insights and predictive modeling.
- **Integration**: Relational databases simplify merging diverse datasets, including wearable and EHR data.

#### A4. Usage of Business Data

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Queries on HealthMetric detect abnormal vitals.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Joining EHR_Record and HealthMetric tables yields insights for individualized care.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Aggregated data informs treatment plans.
- **Reporting and Dashboards**: Summaries of device usage, patient outcomes, and health trends guide strategic decisions.

### B. Logical Data Model

Below is a conceptual outline of the primary entities and their relationships:

1. **Patient**  
   - `patient_id` (PK)  
   - `first_name`  
   - `last_name`  
   - `date_of_birth`  
   - `gender`  
   - `contact_info`

2. **Device**  
   - `device_id` (PK)  
   - `patient_id` (FK)  
   - `device_type`  
   - `manufacturer`  
   - `registration_date`

3. **HealthMetric**  
   - `metric_id` (PK)  
   - `device_id` (FK)  
   - `metric_type`  
   - `metric_value`  
   - `timestamp`

4. **EHR_Record**  
   - `record_id` (PK)  
   - `patient_id` (FK)  
   - `diagnosis`  
   - `treatment`  
   - `visit_date`

5. **PatientReportedOutcome**  
   - `outcome_id` (PK)  
   - `patient_id` (FK)  
   - `reported_metric`  
   - `comments`  
   - `report_date`

In the final implementation, a surrogate key (e.g., `tracker_id`) may be introduced for any dataset lacking a suitable primary key (e.g., fitness trackers).

### C. Database Objects and Storage

1. **Tables**: Each entity above will be stored in a separate table, enforcing primary and foreign keys.
2. **Views**: Could be created for common join operations (e.g., a view combining `Patient` and `EHR_Record` for quick clinical data access).
3. **Indexes**:  
   - Primary keys ensure clustering indexes on each table.  
   - Additional indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `timestamp` in `HealthMetric`) improve performance.
4. **Storage Files**:  
   - Data files hold structured table data.  
   - Transaction logs maintain a record of changes for recovery and auditing.  
   - Backup files are regularly generated for disaster recovery.

---

### D. Scalability Concerns

- **Partitioning**: Tables with high volumes (e.g., `HealthMetric`) can be partitioned by date or device.
- **Indexing Strategy**: Selective indexing ensures fast read performance without excessive overhead.
- **Replication**: Replicating the database across multiple nodes may be considered if real-time read demands grow.
- **Sharding (Future)**: For extremely large datasets, sharding by patient region or device type can be explored.

### E. Privacy and Security Measures

1. **Compliance**: Adhere to HIPAA and relevant data protection standards.
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., medical data) and in transit (SSL/TLS).
3. **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access (RBAC) to restrict user permissions.
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all data access and modifications for accountability.
5. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically evaluate vulnerabilities, patch known risks, and update policies.

## Part 2: Implementation

### F. Implementation Steps

1. **Database Creation**  
   - Write and execute a script to create a new database instance named `D597 Task 1`.
   - Provide a screenshot showing successful creation.

2. **Data Import**  
   - Use `LOAD DATA INFILE`, `COPY`, or an equivalent bulk-import command to load CSV records into the corresponding tables.
   - Provide a screenshot confirming correct data insertion.

3. **Queries to Retrieve Information**  
   - Write three queries addressing the core business problem (e.g., identifying patients with abnormal health metrics, generating real-time health insights).
   - Show each query script and its successful execution output.

4. **Optimization Techniques**  
   - Apply indexing or query rewriting to enhance performance.
   - Provide screenshots or metrics showing improved run times.

## Part 3: Presentation

### G. Presentation Walk-Through

1. **Recorded Demonstration**  
   - Create a Panopto video featuring a walkthrough of your functional database solution.  
   - Show yourself and your on-screen environment, explaining how your schema and queries meet the project objectives.

2. **Key Demonstration Points**  
   - **Performance Optimization**: Discuss how indexing strategies and database design improve query speed.  
   - **Technical Environment**: Describe the DBMS version, OS, and relevant tools.  
   - **Query Functionality**: Run each of the three queries, explaining how they solve the identified business problem.  
   - **Scalability**: Briefly mention how partitioning or replication could be leveraged if user data scales further.
