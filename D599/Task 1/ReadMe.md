# TCN1 Task 1: Data Cleaning and Profiling

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **TCN1 ‚Äî Task 1: Data Cleaning and Profiling** as part of the WGU course *Data Preparation and Exploration (D599)*. The goal of this task is to review, clean, and document the quality of a dataset related to employee turnover in a large technology firm, in order to optimize it for future analysis and modeling.

## üßæ Task Summary

The objective of this task is to evaluate and clean a dataset on employee turnover. You will profile the dataset by referencing the accompanying data dictionary, perform data wrangling to identify and correct quality issues, and submit documentation, cleaned data, and an explanatory video as final deliverables.
