# TCN1 Task 2: Data Exploration

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **TCN1 ‚Äî Task 2: Data Exploration**, part of the WGU course *Data Preparation and Exploration (D599)*. The objective of this task is to analyze health insurance data using univariate, bivariate, parametric, and nonparametric statistical methods. The goal is to uncover trends and insights to support business decisions.
