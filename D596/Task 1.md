## B. Application of Analytics in Healthcare: Predicting Patient Satisfaction & Access Bottlenecks

Here, I discuss employing predictive analytics—specifically regression modeling and support vector regression—to address the real-world clinical problem of declining patient satisfaction and reduced access to specialist care, based on my previous CMS data analytics project.

### Position Within the Analytics Life Cycle  
- **Phase Applied:** Modeling  
- **Application Case:** Predictive analytics were utilized to identify relationships between patient volumes, access to specialists, and satisfaction scores.  
  - **Clinical Context:** In healthcare, patient and provider satisfaction directly influence quality of care as well as organizational stability. Understanding these relationships has critical implications for resource allocation, staffing decisions, and patient outcomes.

### Risks Associated with Predictive Models  
1. **Model Overfitting:** The possibility exists that models will overly rely on historical data patterns, limiting predictive capability when generalized to different clinical settings.  
2. **Data Bias:** Clinically collected datasets often have inherent demographic and geographic biases that may unduly influence model outcomes.
3. **Clinical Interpretability:** Complex models may pose challenges in communicating results clearly to healthcare providers, patients, and stakeholders unfamiliar with analytical methods.

### Clinical Problem Defined  
The pressing issue involved patient dissatisfaction and declining specialist access resulting from increased patient volumes. Predictive analytics facilitated identification of key variables driving these issues, aiding healthcare administrators in pinpointing operational adjustments necessary to maintain quality and patient-centred care.

## C. Decision-making in Healthcare Analytics Method Selection  

### Rationale for Model Selection  
- **Approach:** Evaluated various predictive techniques, ultimately selecting linear regression (for clear clinical interpretability between patient volume and satisfaction) and support vector regression (for its ability to handle non-linear complexities in specialist access data).  
- **Healthcare Context Needs:** The methods chosen balance analytical complexity with clinical interpretability, supporting health administrators in translating detailed analyses into meaningful operational changes.

### Outcomes and Clinical Benefits  
- **Realized Results:**  
  - Models successfully highlighted patient volume thresholds affecting key satisfaction measures and specialist accessibility.
  - Simulated deployments indicated potential improvements in patient satisfaction and reduced access disparities when insights informed staffing or operational restructuring.

### Ethical and Clinical Considerations  
- **Patient Privacy:** Ensuring confidentiality through data anonymization and adherence to healthcare privacy requirements (HIPAA compliance).  
- **Model Bias and Equity:** Continuous monitoring for inequities impacting vulnerable patient groups, geographic disparities, or underserved populations.  
- **Transparency in Communication:** Clearly explaining analytical insights and methods to maintain clinical trust and support collaborative decision-making.
