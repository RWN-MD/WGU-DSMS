# UGN1 Task 1: Linear Regression Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **UGN1 ‚Äî Task 1: Linear Regression Analysis**, part of the WGU course *Statistical Data Mining (D600)*. The objective of this task is to create, optimize, and interpret a multiple linear regression model using a cleaned dataset to inform a real-world business scenario.

## üßæ Task Summary

As a data analyst, you will use a cleaned dataset to build a regression model, test assumptions, interpret results, and recommend actions based on prediction performance. The goal is to analyze key factors influencing housing outcomes and support decision-making using linear regression.
