# UGN1 Task 2: Logistic Regression Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **UGN1 ‚Äî Task 2: Logistic Regression Analysis**, part of the WGU course *Statistical Data Mining (D600)*. The objective of this task is to build, optimize, and interpret a logistic regression model using a cleaned dataset to support a real-world organizational decision-making scenario.
